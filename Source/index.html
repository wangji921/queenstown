European settlers followed with their sights set on fertile grazing land. They discovered a whole lot more when gold was found in the region’s waterways. When the gold rush hit the region in the 1860s, it marked the start of an ongoing international fascination with the Queenstown region.</p>
          <h2>Queenstown today</h2>
          <p>Over 2.9 million visitors are drawn to Queenstown each year, including adventurers, filmmakers, wine enthusiasts, Hollywood and Bollywood stars and US Presidents to enjoy their own unforgettable travel experience. Visitors come to experience our unique scenery, search for adventure, seek out relaxation and rejuvenation, or to just breathe our pure mountain air.</p>
          <h2>Central Queenstown</h2>
          <p>Central Queenstown is a sophisticated town with a fantastic choice of restaurants, a lively bar scene and excellent shopping. The picturesque town sits on the edge of Lake Wakatipu and you’ll experience a unique energy and atmosphere all year-round.</p>
          <h2>Queenstown activities</h2>
          <p>The Queenstown region is world-famous for adventure and is the birthplace of many iconic activities including commercial bungy jumping and jetboating. Other activities guaranteed to get your blood pumping include white water rafting, ziplining, 4x4 off-roading, snowsports, paragliding and skydiving.</p>

                <p>Hong Kong matriarch arrives in NZ uninvited for her granddaughter's wedding. Cue cultural misunderstandings, some very confused backpackers and Por Por’s family having to face a few home truths. Expect a few tears as well as laughter in Hweiling Ow’s dazzling performance, in which she plays three generations of one family all at once.</p>
                <p>Although the play is fictional, award-winning playwright Renee Liang has drawn from memories of her two Chinese grandmothers to write this loving tribute to families separated by time and distance. The set features images drawn from Liang’s own family album.</p>
                <p>Performed in English, the play is suitable for school groups, families (ages 7 and over), those interested in the migrant experience, and anyone up for a warm and funny night of theatre.</p>
                <p>Written by Renee Liang, starring Hweiling Ow, directed by Borni Te Rongopai Tukiwaho, with lighting and sound design by Sam Mence and set design by Deborah McGuire.</p>
                <p>“A simply staged, gentle one-woman play encompassing three generations, the warm heart of the play is Por-Por - canny, fun-loving, bent double.” NZ Herald .</p>

                <p>Two well-known New Zealand musicians perform a programme of Classical and early Romantic pieces on period instruments, transporting the audience to another place and time.</p>
                <p>Hammers & Horsehair presents a rich and varied programme. The virtuosity of Bréval's Sonata in G and Romberg's Grand Sonata in E-flat major is complemented by one of Mozart's best-loved Piano Sonatas, the playful and charming Sonata in C K330. Two works by Beethoven, his witty set of Twelve Variations on “Ein Mädchen oder Weibchen” and the Sonata for Piano and Cello Op 5 No 1, open and close the concert. </p>
